# Azure Database Migration

## Overview
In this project, I architect and implement a cloud-based database system on Microsoft Azure, showcasing my hands-on expertise in cloud engineering.
I begin by establishing a production environment database. Subsequently, I migrate the database to Azure SQL Database, focusing on crucial aspects like data backup, restoration, and automated scheduling. 
A pivotal phase of the project involved simulating a disaster recovery scenario with potential data loss. Furthermore, I explore the complexities of geo-replication and failover configuration to ensure data availability even under challenging conditions.
To enhance security, I employ Microsoft Entra ID integration to define access roles, adding an extra layer of control and protection.
